// Periodicity detection over recorded main-thread stalls.
//
// Issue #5 was diagnosed by hand: 55 long tasks logged as 'idle' (no Seek phase
// overlapping them) looked like undifferentiated noise in the report, and only
// became legible after dumping startTimeMs and differencing it by hand — at
// which point they resolved into one event repeating on a 3,600,000 ms period
// with ±2 ms of jitter, for twelve hours straight. That is not a workload; a
// clock that stable is a `setInterval`, which immediately rules OUT everything
// event-driven and turns "Seek makes Obsidian lag" into "something in this
// window runs an hourly job".
//
// Nobody should have to do that by hand twice, so the report does it. The
// startTime axis is the one to difference: it comes from performance.now(),
// which is monotonic and immune to wall-clock adjustment, unlike `timestamp`
// (which is also written at observer DELIVERY time — after the task ends — so
// differencing it smears by each task's duration).
